# Button - verification record

PRD F17 requires a per-component record rather than a blanket claim. This one is written from the
tests that actually run, so it can be checked rather than believed.

**Boundary:** client-only (see `client-boundary.json`).

## Keyboard

Enter and Space activate; a disabled button keeps its tab stop (D0028) and does not activate; loading sets aria-busy and preserves width; `as="a"` renders a link that does not navigate while disabled.


| Key | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Tab | One stop. A disabled button KEEPS its stop (D0028/D0058). |
| Enter / Space | Activates. |
| Enter / Space, when disabled | No-op - `aria-disabled` does not stop activation, so the handler suppresses it. |
| Enter, as `as="a"` and disabled | Does not navigate; default is prevented. |

## Recorded manual keyboard pass

**Not performed. This is outstanding, and it is the one artefact here that automation cannot
supply.**

An earlier version of this file claimed a by-hand walk on 2026-08-23 across macOS 15, Safari 18 and
Chrome 128, with a result. No such walk happened - the text was written from the keyboard table
rather than from a browser, and the identical paragraph appeared in all 23 verification records
including one for a component that is a stub. It is removed rather than reworded: a fabricated
record is worse than an absent one, because an absent one is visible.

What IS verified is above, by tests that run. What a real pass adds is the part no test reaches:
whether the focus order feels right, whether the ring is actually visible against each surface, and
what a screen reader says rather than what the accessibility tree contains.

**To record one:** walk every row of the keyboard table above, in both themes and both densities,
pointer unused; then replace this section with the date, the OS and browsers, and the result per
row - including anything surprising. `check-verification.mjs` requires this section to state either
a real pass or, as here, that it is outstanding.

## Accessibility

Focus indicator is the two-part ring (D0054), which survives every emphasis surface. Disabled text is NOT contrast-exempt - Clara exceeds WCAG here deliberately.

## What is verified automatically

- axe (serious and critical) in all four theme x density combinations - `check:axe`
- Keyboard behaviour above, in `../__tests__/matrix.test.tsx` and `../__tests__/primitives.test.tsx`
- Token-only styling, no literals and no tier 1 reads - `check:component-css`
- Colour pairings measured against the palette, both themes - `check:contrast`

## Stated gaps

- **Screen reader testing is not automated.** axe checks the accessibility tree, not what NVDA or
  VoiceOver actually announce. PRD F17 names NVDA as a stated gap; it stays one.
- **Visual regression is not yet wired** (gate 7), so the rendered appearance is unverified - only
  the markup, the tokens and the measured contrast are.
