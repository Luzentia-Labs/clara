# Heading - verification record

PRD F17 requires a per-component record rather than a blanket claim. This one is written from
the tests that actually run, so it can be checked rather than believed.

A heading whose visual size is independent of its outline level.

**Boundary:** server-capable (see `../../../client-boundary.json`). No function props, no state,
no browser APIs, so it carries no `"use client"` directive and renders on the server.

## Keyboard

Not focusable. Headings are navigated with a screen reader's own heading commands, not with Tab.

| Key | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Tab | No stop. Headings are navigated with a screen reader's own heading commands, not with Tab. |
| Any key | No handler. |

## Recorded manual keyboard pass

**Not performed. This is outstanding, and it is the one artefact here that automation cannot
supply.**

An earlier version of this file claimed a by-hand walk on 2026-08-23 across macOS 15, Safari 18 and
Chrome 128, with a result. No such walk happened - the text was written from the keyboard table
rather than from a browser, and the identical paragraph appeared in all 23 verification records
including one for a component that is a stub. It is removed rather than reworded: a fabricated
record is worse than an absent one, because an absent one is visible.

What IS verified is above, by tests that run. What a real pass adds is the part no test reaches:
whether the focus order feels right, whether the ring is actually visible against each surface, and
what a screen reader says rather than what the accessibility tree contains.

**To record one:** walk every row of the keyboard table above, in both themes and both densities,
pointer unused; then replace this section with the date, the OS and browsers, and the result per
row - including anything surprising. `check-verification.mjs` requires this section to state either
a real pass or, as here, that it is outstanding.

## Accessibility

`level` sets the element (h1-h6) and `size` sets the appearance, deliberately separately. Tying them together forces the author to break either the document outline or the visual hierarchy, and the outline is the one that loses in practice - which is what makes heading navigation useless.

## What is verified automatically

- axe (serious and critical) in all four theme x density combinations - `check:axe`
- The behaviour above, in `../__tests__/primitives.test.tsx` and `../__tests__/matrix.test.tsx`
- Token-only styling, no literals and no tier 1 reads - `check:component-css`
- Colour pairings measured against the palette, both themes - `check:contrast`

## Stated gaps

- **Screen reader testing is not automated.** axe checks the accessibility tree, not what NVDA or
  VoiceOver actually announce. PRD F17 names NVDA as a stated gap; it stays one.
- **Visual regression is not yet wired** (gate 7), so the rendered appearance is unverified - only
  the markup, the tokens and the measured contrast are.
